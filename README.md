# Real Time Bus Tracker 🚌

This exercise was an animated map that fetches current bus data from the MBTA (Massachusetts BayTransportation Authority), and updates their live locations every 15 seconds to a Google Map.

Developed as part of an assignment with the MiT full stack coding certification. 

# How to run 🤓

This file can run from the index.html file, along with two png files of map markers. This can be ran locally. Store all files in one file location. 

# Roadmap of future improvements 🗺️ 

In the future I would like to figure out a way to run this file with a public map token, rather than purchasing a personal API key.
